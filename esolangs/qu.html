            <h2>Qu Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                Qu is my third attempt at creating an Esoteric Programming Language.<br>
                Each release of Qu is indicated by the date it was released. The first release of Qu was on February 17th, 2024 and thus is 2024.02.17.<br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                February 17th, 2024: Qu was first publicly released.<br>
                February 25th, 2024: Qu 2024.02.25 was released, which is its first Turing complete release.<br>
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                Qu is a language that is based on the concept of a queue as opposed to a stack.<br>
                The data in the queue can be manipulated by adding and removing data from the front of the queue using the provided instructions.<br>
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
                Here is the link to Qu on GitHub if you would like to utilize it.<br>
                <a href="https://github.com/Lemon-Juiced/Qu">Qu</a><br>
            </div>

            <h2>Compilation Instructions</h2>
            If you have downloaded Qu from GitHub, there are two ways you can start.<br>
            If you would prefer to use the bundled "qu.exe" file you can skip steps 1 and 2.<br>
            These instructions use VSCode's notation, which is powered by PowerShell. If you are using another terminal, the notation may slightly differ.<br>
            These instructions use g++ as the compiler, if you have another compiler the notation may also change.<br>
            Step 1. From your terminal, <code>cd .\dev\lemonjuice\qu\</code><br>
            Step 2. <code>g++ .\qu.cpp -o qu .\error\errorHandler.cpp .\node\node.cpp .\operation\operationHandler.cpp</code><br>
            Note: The <code>-o</code> flag is optional, but it does enable compiler optimization, which is suggested.<br>
            Step 3. You can now run a <code>.qu</code> file with <code>.\qu.exe {fileName}.qu"</code>.<br>
            If you need examples some exist on this page and in the GitHub repository.<br>
