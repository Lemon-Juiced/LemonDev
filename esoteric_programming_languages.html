                Both CScroll and JScroll are my second attempt at creating an Esoteric Programming Language.<br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                JScroll was first created on January 21st, 2024 as a compiler that ran on the JVM. Thus, JScroll was compiled to Java code then run on the JVM.<br>
                CScroll 1.0 was created January 30th, 2024 as the successor to JScroll, written in C/C++ as opposed to Java. CScroll is in all essence JScroll 2.0.
                This version of the language was a direct port from Java to C/C++ so all instructions remained the same. 
                At this point, JScroll will no longer be maintained as CScroll has replaced it (even though I love Java and the JVM).<br>
                CScroll 1.0.1 was released February 5th, 2024 which added conditional logic, a file extension check, and technical/performance changes.<br>
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
