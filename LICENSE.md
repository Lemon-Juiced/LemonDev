# LemonDev FOSS License v1.1
Revision Date: 4/8/2025

## Foreword
This license is provided by a developer who wishes to share their work freely, openly, and fairly.
While every effort has been made to ensure clarity and fairness, the author is not a lawyer and does not provide any legal guarantees or assume liability for any issues arising from the use of the code covered by this license.

## Preamble
The LemonDev FOSS License is designed to promote the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
FOSS fosters collaboration, transparency, and innovation by allowing anyone to learn from, improve, and share software freely.
By adopting this license, the author aims to contribute to a world where technology is accessible and equitable for all.

All code released under this license is both free and open source, as defined below:

### Free
The code is free to use, modify, and distribute for any purpose, including commercial use, without restriction.

### Open Source
The source code is openly available, allowing anyone to view, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of this license.

## Contributions
Contributions to the code are encouraged and welcomed. However, any contributions must also be licensed under this same license to ensure that the code remains free and open source for all users.

## Updates to the License
This license may be updated or revised at any time. The latest version will always be publicly available. However, the following conditions apply to updates:

1. Code released under a previous version of this license will remain governed by that version unless explicitly re-licensed under the updated version.
2. If a newer version of this license is released, it will surely be more restrictive than the previous version, given how permissive this license is.
   As a result, any code released under the newer version cannot be retroactively downgraded to an earlier version. (This is to avoid potential legal complications.)

Updates to this license, are unlikely to occur, but if they do, they will be made with the intention of improving clarity and fairness for all users.
