            <p>
                My projects contained in this section of the website are projects I would like to consider more "professional" than my other projects.
                The reason I consider them more "professional" is because they can be used in a production environment and are not strictly just for fun.
                These projects are almost all open source and are available on my GitHub.

                    <b>Written In:</b> Bash <br>
                    Tara is a modern command line suite designed to simplify working with tar files on Linux and other systems. <br>
                    The goal of Tara is to provide clear, purpose-driven commands for tar file management, making the process more intuitive for users who find traditional tar commands confusing or cumbersome.

                    RPJL, short for "Rob's Professional Java Library", is a Java library I have created for a few purposes.
                    This project is mainly meant to be usable in a production environment, but can also be used elsewhere.

                    This is the "black-sheep" of my projects as it is not a programming language or a tool, but rather a license that I have created for my projects.
                    This license's goal is to be as permissive as possible, allowing for code (under this license) to be used in any way possible, including commercial use.
