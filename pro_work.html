            <p>
                My projects contained in this section of the website are projects I would like to consider more "professional" than my other projects.
                The reason I consider them more "professional" is because they can be used in a production environment and are not strictly just for fun.
                These projects are almost all open source and are available on my GitHub.

                    DTar is a command line suite of tools designed to make it easier to work with tar files.
                    Even as a Linux user, tar files and the associated commands are somewhat confusing.
                    I believe the remedy for this is to split the tar command into multiple commands, each named clearly and with a specific purpose.

                    RPJL, short for "Rob's Professional Java Library", is a Java library I have created for a few purposes.
                    This project is mainly meant to be usable in a production environment, but can also be used elsewhere.

                    This is the "black-sheep" of my projects as it is not a programming language or a tool, but rather a license that I have created for my projects.
                    This license's goal is to be as permissive as possible, allowing for code (under this license) to be used in any way possible, including commercial use.
