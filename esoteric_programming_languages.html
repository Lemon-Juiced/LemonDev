                Both CScroll and JScroll are my second attempt at creating an Esoteric Programming Language.<br>
                <h3>Brief History</h3>
                January 21st, 2024: JScroll was first created as a compiler that ran on the JVM. Thus, JScroll was compiled to Java code then run on the JVM.<br>
                January 30th, 2024: CScroll 1.0 was created as the successor to JScroll, written in C/C++ as opposed to Java. CScroll is in all essence JScroll 2.0.<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;This version of the language was a direct port from Java to C/C++ so all instructions remained the same.<br>
                February 6th, 2024: Cscroll Documentation was moved to <a href="https://lemonjuice.dev/cscroll_jscroll_documentation.html">here</a> on lemonjuice.dev.<br>
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
