**About Me**  
Hi, I'm Lemon! I'm a programmer and Linux enthusiast who loves to experiment and create.

**Interests**  
I spend a lot of time tinkering with Linux distros and exploring new programming languages. I enjoy making things that are both fun and useful, whether that's a new shell, a quirky esoteric language, or a mod for Minecraft.

**Projects**  
My projects range from open source tools and scripts to game mods and professional work. I like to share what I learn and build, hoping it helps others or inspires new ideas.

**Philosophy**  
I advocate for open source and follow the Unix philosophy: keep things simple, modular, and transparent. I believe in using the right tool for the jobâ€”whether that's scripting for automation or compiled languages for performance. I also work to keep big tech spyware out of my devices and hardware.

**Aesthetics**  
Retro aesthetics are cool, and I enjoy software and design that brings a bit of classic style to modern tech.
