            <h2>CScroll/JScroll Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                Both CScroll and JScroll are my second attempt at creating an Esoteric Programming Language.<br>
                <h3>History</h3>
                JScroll was first created on January 21st, 2024 as a compiler that ran on the JVM. Thus, JScroll was compiled to Java code then run on the JVM.<br>
                CScroll 1.0 was created January 30th, 2024 as the successor to JScroll, written in C/C++ as opposed to Java. CScroll is in all essence JScroll 2.0.
                This version of the language was a direct port from Java to C/C++ so all instructions remained the same. 
                At this point, JScroll will no longer be maintained as CScroll has replaced it (even though I love Java and the JVM).<br>
                CScroll 1.0.1 was released February 5th, 2024 which added conditional logic, a file extension check, and technical/performance changes.<br>
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                CScroll (and JScroll) are languages based on a "tape", that a pointer scrolls across. 
                The data at the points in this tape can be manipulated when the pointer is hovering over them. The data by default at all of these points are saved as an integer.<br>
                The syntax of the language allows the user to scroll back on forth on the tape to increment and decrement the data at any position. 
                Additionally, the pointer itself can store one piece of data that can be moved around the program and desposited back onto the tape.<br>
                <h3>GitHub</h3>
                Here are links to CScroll and JScroll on GitHub if you would like to utilize them.<br>
                <a href="https://github.com/Lemon-Juiced/CScroll">CScroll</a><br>

            <h2>Compilation Instructions</h2>
            If you have downloaded CScroll from GitHub, there are two ways you can start.<br>
            If you would prefer to use the bundled "cscroll.exe" file you can skip steps 1 and 2.<br>
            These instructions use VSCode's notation, which is powered by PowerShell. If you are using another terminal, the notation may slightly differ.<br>
            These instructions use g++ as the compiler, if you have another compiler the notation may also change.<br>
            Step 1. From your terminal, cd .\dev\lemonjuice\cscroll\<br>
            Step 2. g++ .\cscroll.cpp -o cscroll .\util\Error_Handler.cpp<br>
            Note: The "-o" flag is optional, but it does enable compiler optimization, which is suggested.<br>
            Step 3. You can now run a ".cscroll" file with ".\cscroll.exe {fileName}.cscroll".<br>
            If you need examples some exist on this page and in the GitHub repository.<br>
